# Values

A value is something AppyTappy reads from one part of an application's window,
such as a number, how full a bar is, or whether an icon shows. Automations
watch values and act on them.

The **Values** page lists each saved value under its application, with how
it reads and the automations that use it. A green dot marks an application
whose window is open now.

## Make a value

On the Values page, select **New value**.

1. **Pick the window.** Choose the application in **Save to**, then
   pick its window in the list of open windows; type in the filter to find
   one. Picking a window a saved application finds chooses that application.
   If the application isn't saved yet, select **Add application** to
   [add it](Applications.md#add-change-or-remove-an-application) first. Then
   select **Capture this window**.
2. **Take screenshots.** Select **Take screenshot**, or press the screenshot
   shortcut, `F9` at first. The shortcut works while the other application
   has the keyboard, so you can carry on in it until it shows what you want
   and press `F9` then. To use other keys, select **Change shortcut** and
   press them, or change it in [Settings](Settings.md). F1 to F24, Print Screen,
   and Pause work alone. A letter, a digit, Space, an arrow, Insert, Delete,
   Home, End, Page Up, or Page Down needs Ctrl, Alt, Shift, or Win with it, so
   it keeps working everywhere else. Other keys can't be the shortcut.
3. **Where to read.** Type a **Value name**, such as `Progress`, and choose
   the **Check**, one of the four [checks](#checks) below. On a screenshot,
   drag to draw a box around what to read. Drag inside the box to move it, or
   drag a corner to resize it. The **X**, **Y**, **Width**, and **Height**
   fields set it to the exact pixel, counted in the window's own pixels from
   its top-left corner. Then select **Next: how to read it**.
4. **How to read it.** Set up the check, as [Checks](#checks) describes. The
   box under it then shows what AppyTappy reads on the live window, a few
   times a second. If the check cannot work, such as a bar whose filled and
   empty colors are the same, it says why there.
5. **Save.** Select **Save value**. **Back** returns to the first step.

AppyTappy keeps the screenshots until you select **Change window** or leave
the new value. Before either drops work you have not saved, it asks first:
select **Keep this window** or **Stay** to carry on, as
[Leave before you save](../Home.md#leave-before-you-save) describes.

## Checks

- **Number** reads a number, such as `87%` or `-12.5`, with a
  [reference](References.md): the color and shapes of the application's
  characters. Pick one of the application's references, or select
  **New reference from this region** to make one from the region you drew.
  **Edit** changes the picked one, such as to teach it a digit it does not
  know yet. Turn on **Whole number only** to ignore every digit after the
  decimal point, so `87.5%` reads as 87. The reference still has to know the
  point, so teach it on a screenshot that shows one.
  To read numbers with a thousands separator, such as `1,234`, teach the
  reference the `,` too. A `.` is always the decimal point, and a `,` only
  separates thousands: it counts only between groups of three digits, so
  `12,5` reads as 12. A number written with its point first, such as `.5`,
  reads as 0.5, and a `.` with no digit after it, such as `...`, is not a
  number.
- **Bar fill** reads how full a bar is, from 0 to 100. Use **Pick** next to
  **Filled color** and click a filled part of the bar, then next to
  **Empty color** and click an empty part. Borders and labels inside the
  region don't count.
- **Color** is yes when the region's average color is close to the
  **Color to look for**, such as a light that turns red. Use **Pick** and
  click the color on a screenshot. **Tolerance** says how close: drag the
  slider or type a number.
- **State** reads which of a few named looks the region shows, such as a
  corner that says `PAUSED` or `LIVE`. Take a screenshot of each look. Select
  one, then **Add a state from this screenshot** under **States**, and name
  the state, such as `Paused`. A screenshot gives at most one state, and a
  value can have up to 16. The value reads as the state whose screenshot the
  region looks most like, or `none` when it is like none of them, such as
  while the corner is empty. **Tolerance** says how much, on average, the
  region may differ from a state's screenshot and still read as it. Each
  state shows how many pixels it compares, and **matches now** while the
  live window reads as it. To compare only the thing itself and not what is
  behind it, [select it](#select-the-thing-in-a-state).

State names are up to 32 characters, with no space at either end. Two states
cannot share a name, ignoring case, and none can be named `none`.

## Select the thing in a state

A **State** check compares every pixel of its region, so a background that
changes, such as a sky behind an icon or a scene behind a word, can stop a
state from matching. **Select with**, under **Where to read**, marks just the
thing on the screenshot shown instead:

- **Box** draws the region by hand, as for other checks.
- **Snap** takes a rough box. Drag one around the thing with some plain
  background on every side, and it shrinks to fit. The background around the
  thing and between its parts, such as inside the letter O, is left out.
- **Click** takes the thing under the pointer. Click it, and the selection
  spreads over the colors like the one you clicked and fills any holes, such
  as a star inside a shield.

Hold **Shift** while you drag or click to add a part, or **Alt** to take one
away. **Color match** says how close a color must be to count as the same:
raise it if the selection stops short, and lower it if it spills over.
Selecting on a screenshot with no state yet adds one for it, so you can name
it under **How to read it**. Each state keeps its own selection, made on its
own screenshot, and the region fits around what every state selects.
**Clear selection** on a state compares its whole region again.

While **Ignore the background** is on, the pixels a state's selection leaves
out are shaded over its screenshot, and the check skips them. Turn it off to
compare the whole region again. You can still adjust the region by hand with
**Box**; anything you add to it counts as background.

The **Number** check cannot read rotated text, characters that touch each
other, or text on a background of the same color. For those, a **Color** or
**State** check on the part that matters often works instead.

## Window size

A value reads only while the window is the size it was on the screenshot you
drew the region on. If you use the window at more than one size, make a value
at each size, with an automation for each; AppyTappy reads the values made at
the window's current size. Each state of a **State** check comes from a
screenshot of that same size, and trying or saving it says so if one is not.

While the window is closed or at a size no value was made at, AppyTappy reads
nothing. Automations neither run nor undo their changes until it can read
again.

## When an application updates

An update can move what a value reads, so AppyTappy remembers which build of
the application its values were checked against: the version of its
executable, such as `1.4.2.0`, its size, and when it was written. It records
the build that runs when you save the application's first value. Deleting every value, or changing which executable
the application is, forgets it. The Values page shows it next to the
application's name, such as **checked against 1.4.2.0 on Nov 8, 2026**.

When the application runs a different build, the Values page says so under the
application's name, such as **Changed since its values were checked (1.4.2.0
then, 1.5.0.0 now)**. AppyTappy still reads the values. Check what each one
reads now, such as with the application's [overlay](Overlay.md), and make any
that read wrong again. Then select **Mark as checked**, which records the build
that runs now. The application has to be running for that. While it runs and
no build is recorded, such as for values made before AppyTappy recorded
builds, the Values page offers **Mark as checked** too.

[AppyTappy's log](Troubleshooting.md#appytappys-log) says so as well, each time
the application starts while it has an automation that can run. AppyTappy finds
the executable without opening the application, so this works whatever the
application's [anti-cheat](Applications.md#anti-cheat) setting.

## Delete a value

Select **Delete** next to a value, then confirm. A value that an automation
watches cannot be deleted: the Values page names the automations to change or
delete first.
